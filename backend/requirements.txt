## Dependencies - You need to install these via pip:

a. flask  
b. flask-sqlalchemy  
c. flask-bcrypt  
d. flask-jwt-extended  
(email-validator  
password-validator)

## Database setup
Requirements: Install SQLite DB Browser for viewing the database.  
When **backend/run.py** is executed, the **insti_forum.db** file is created in backend/instance.  
The database and tables are created automatically once the backend server is run for the first time.  
To reset the database, stop the backend server, delete the insti_forum.db file and restart the backend again, to delete all old data.

**For JWT_SECRET_KEY**,

Add the user environment variable **JWT_SECRET_KEY = dev-secret-key**.
